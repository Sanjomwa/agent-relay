# Agent Relay (SQLite starter)

Agent Relay is a small FastAPI service for registering agents, delivering one
task at a time, and recording results. The local starter is self-contained:
SQLite persists the queue and attempts, while workers execute tasks on their own
machines. The included worker deterministically returns `input.upper()`.

## Run it

```bash
uv sync
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/> for the token-based local dashboard. The default
database is `./agent-relay.db`; set `RELAY_DATABASE_URL` to use another SQLite
file. `GET /health` is a liveness check and `GET /ready` verifies database
connectivity and schema (it queries the real tables, so a wiped volume
reports not-ready instead of passing with zero tables).

Register two identities and send a task:

```bash
alice=$(curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/agents \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name":"alice"}')
bob=$(curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/agents \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name":"uppercase"}')
```

The response contains each agent's secret `token` once. Keep it outside source
control. Use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for all subsequent API calls;
registration is the only unauthenticated endpoint. For a shared installation,
set `RELAY_ENROLLMENT_SECRET` and send it as `X-Enrollment-Secret` when
registering.

## Run the deterministic worker

The worker can register itself and save credentials in a mode-0600 JSON file:

```bash
uv run python main.py worker \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
  --name uppercase \
  --credentials ./uppercase-credentials.json \
  --worker-id laptop-1
```

For failure/redelivery demonstrations, make local execution intentionally slow
and stop the process after one completion:

```bash
uv run python main.py worker --credentials ./uppercase-credentials.json \
  --slow-seconds 75 --worker-id slow-laptop
```

The worker heartbeats during long work. Killing it leaves the claim leased;
after the 60-second lease expires, another worker can claim the task with a new
token and incremented attempt number. `RELAY_LEASE_SECONDS` and
`RELAY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` are configurable server settings.

An existing credential can also be supplied explicitly (the token is not
written to disk):

```bash
uv run python main.py worker --agent-id agent_123 --token agt_… --worker-id laptop-2
```

## Storage and delivery behavior

`database.py` contains SQLAlchemy models, SQLite WAL setup, and the isolated
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction helper. `storage.py` contains task/claim/recovery
operations; routes and request models are kept in `main.py` and `schemas.py`.
SQLite does not provide PostgreSQL's `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, so the starter
serializes writer transactions to make concurrent claims safe across processes.
Students can port this storage seam to PostgreSQL later without changing the
HTTP protocol or lifecycle in `SPEC.md`.

Claims are at-least-once and leased for 60 seconds by default. Heartbeats extend
an active lease. A completion or failure must include the recipient's bearer
token and claim token. Repeating the exact terminal request with that claim
token is idempotent; a stale token or different result receives `409`.

## Verify

The test suite covers the main protocol, sender/recipient access boundaries,
hashed claim-token behavior, idempotent terminal retries, concurrent claims,
lease expiry before and after recovery, pagination/error shape, and dashboard
asset serving:

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

Tests default to a scratch database at `/tmp/agent-relay-test.db` so they
don't reset your dev server's `./agent-relay.db`. The fixture drops and
recreates all tables on whatever `RELAY_DATABASE_URL` points at, so stop
the dev server first or set `RELAY_DATABASE_URL` to a scratch file before
running tests against another database.

This starter intentionally does not include Docker, Kubernetes, CI, external
brokers, an LLM, or a PostgreSQL implementation. Those are deployment and
student-port concerns rather than part of the local relay protocol.

## Homework 4: Operations and Security

The full write-up is [docs/operations-and-security-report.md](docs/operations-and-security-report.md): architecture, the incident loop, the primary incident and the DB drill, alerting lessons, the security audit, corrections and limitations, and how to reproduce everything.

- [`observability/`](observability/): OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo and Grafana (a separate Compose project), the dashboard and the `RelayClaimCompleteErrorRatioHigh` alert.
- [`scripts/release.sh`](scripts/release.sh) and [`scripts/traffic.py`](scripts/traffic.py): versioned releases recorded in `deploy/history.jsonl`, and a load generator.
- [`incident-response/`](incident-response/): evidence collection, the read-only responder, the autonomy policy (`autonomy-policy.yaml`, `policy.py`), runbooks, and recorded incidents under `incidents/`.
- [`security-audit/`](security-audit/): Semgrep and model-review results, human triage with dispositions, and the responder capability inventory.

Setup: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and `observability/.env.example` to `observability/.env`, set both secrets, then run `scripts/release.sh` and `docker compose -f observability/compose.yaml up -d`.
